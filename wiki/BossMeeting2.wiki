  # Reconcile Schedule with Tyler
===Discussion:===	
  Tyler went through the system architecture again and gave more detain about the hardware structure of the robot. Also, he expected us to work on two parts first. One is the hardware part which includes the serial port communication problem between ATOM and local brain. Second, the path finding path-finding algorithm which has to rely on the floor plan system.   

===Conclusions:	===
  Hao Wu and Jacky will take charge of the hardware part, the other three members will take care the others. For the next two weeks, Hao Wu and Jacky has to get familiar with the ATOM development tool as well as the servo control configurations. Meanwhile, the other member can start with the research on the image transmission or related matters. More detail internal job distribution will be discussed at our next time meeting.

===Other Information===
  For the first two months of this project, Tyler will be in the Lab every Wed after 5:30PM. If needed, he is willing to arrange a time during weekend to meet with us.
