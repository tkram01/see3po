= Algorithms =

Search strategies includes *uninformed search* (such as [[Breadth-first search]]) and *informed search*. Since we will have floor plan for our robot, *informed search* is considered.

  *  A`*` search 
  *  Hill-climbing search 
  *  Simulated Annealing 
  *  Genetic Algorithms 
  *  Reinforcement Learning 

= Established Codes =

  * Programming Game AI by Example (C++) by Mat Buckland.
