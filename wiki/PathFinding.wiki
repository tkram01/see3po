#summary Development of Path Finding
#labels Host,Featured

= Introduction =

Our Pathfinding component will receive location and facing data from the VoodooAlgorithm, and in turn supply the LocalBrain with movement commands. 

----

Path finding has been broadly used in Robots and AI game (for example, Fieldrunner as shown in Figure 1).

= Algorithms =

Search strategies includes *uninformed search* (such as [[Breadth-first search]]) and *informed search*. Since we will have floor plan for our robot, *informed search* is considered.

  *  Dijkstra 
  *  A`*` search 
  *  Hill-climbing search 
  *  Simulated Annealing 
  *  Genetic Algorithms 
  *  Reinforcement Learning 

= Established Codes =

  * [http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/ QuickGraph] 
  * Programming Game AI by Example by Mat Buckland.(C++)

= Issues =

  * Algorithm choice
