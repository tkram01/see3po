Schedule entries should be in chronological order.

Several items marked 10/11 haven't been completed and haven't been rescheduled. 

The Emulator is marked as complete, but I can't find anywhere on the wiki a description of what the emulator emulates, where to find its code, and how it was tested.

_Reply from the team:_

Schedule entries have been arranged in chronological order.

Out of date items were rescheduled.

We added a [LocalBrainEmulator Emulator] page.

This Google code wiki shows almost no recent progress at all. There is in fact quite a bit visible at the Google group. That is a much better place to find it than in email among team members, but not where it really belongs, which is _here_ on the wiki.

In particular, where is the schedule? Getting one up is a top priority, so you can see whether you are on track.

_Reply from the team:_

Please see [Schedule] page.

You are misusing the Downloads page in Google code. It's for project releases (code and documentation) for the end user, not for internal documents. Make proper wiki pages for those.

_Reply from the team:_

We have moved internal documents to source.
Downloads page has been reserved for project releases.
