== December 7 ==

I am impressed by the progress on the requirements specification. I hope you find that work worth doing - that is, I hope it results in a better project running more smoothly, not just a delay in the real work.

Your schedule doesn't seem to show a plan for what you're planning to deliver as a requirements specification document on the 15th of this month. I do see the GUI release scheduled. That may be sufficient for Tyler, but I need more.

Nice job on the vc presentation. I thought it followed the guidelines best of all the three. Please post the slides on the wiki, on the right page.

Where is your one step build?

Still no response to the query below.

Your [RiskAnalysis Risk Analysis] page lists

Can't find WinCE driver for video cam. 

as high probability high severity. Shouldn't there be a schedule entry for the successful outcome of a search for one?

Nice work on tests for the emulator.

Please fix spelling of "receive" - you have it as "recieve" in several places - unfortunately, some of those places are the names of wiki pages.

The Explorer that the emulator works with isn't Microsoft's IE. The fact that it has the same name is a little confusing (to me). Perhaps use its full name (ViLANExplorer) ?

Schedule entries should be in chronological order.

Several items marked 10/11 haven't been completed and haven't been rescheduled. 

The Emulator is marked as complete, but I can't find anywhere on the wiki a description of what the emulator emulates, where to find its code, and how it was tested.

_Reply from the team:_

Schedule entries have been arranged in chronological order. Please see [Schedule] page.

Out of date items were rescheduled. Please see [Schedule] page.

We added a [LocalBrainEmulator Emulator] page.

This Google code wiki shows almost no recent progress at all. There is in fact quite a bit visible at the Google group. That is a much better place to find it than in email among team members, but not where it really belongs, which is _here_ on the wiki.

In particular, where is the schedule? Getting one up is a top priority, so you can see whether you are on track.

_Reply from the team:_

Please see [Schedule] page.

You are misusing the Downloads page in Google code. It's for project releases (code and documentation) for the end user, not for internal documents. Make proper wiki pages for those.

_Reply from the team:_

We have moved internal documents to source.
Downloads page has been reserved for project releases.
