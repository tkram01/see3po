This Google code wiki shows almost no recent progress at all. There is in fact quite a bit visible at the Google group. That is a much better place to find it than in email among team members, but not where it really belongs, which is _here_ on the wiki.

In particular, where is the schedule? Getting one up is a top priority, so you can see whether you are on track.

You are misusing the Downloads page in Google code. It's for project releases (code and documentation) for the end user, not for internal documents. Make proper wiki pages for those.

_Reply from the team:_

We have moved internal documents to source.
Downloads page has been reserved for project releases.
