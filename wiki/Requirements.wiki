Add vision here.


= Requirements=


=== Camera Interface ===
  * The camera must be made to interface directly with the robot's on-board computer

=== Wireless Image Transmission (Robot to PC) ===
  * The robot will gather images from the on-board camera
  * [optional] the on-board computer will compress the images for transmission
  * The robot will transmit to the desktop PC

=== Wireless Control Transmission (PC to Robot) ===
  * The PC will must transmit instructions in such as way that poor connections will not result in catastrophe. 

=== Floor Plan Processing === 
  * Using some representation of a floor plan, possibly an image and a scale, the central computer must create a model of the floor for use by the path-finding algorithm. 

=== Location ===
  * Using the images and the robot, and the floor plan, the central PC will establish the location of the robot. 

=== Path-finding ===
  * Using the data from the floor plan, the central computer will design a route from the robot's current location to the destination
  * Path-finding must auto-correct based on new visual data from the robot
  * [optional] Path-finding must account for discrepancies between the floor plan and reality, such as obstacles.
