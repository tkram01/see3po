#summary Presentation for pseudo-potential investor.

= Assignments = 

Frank/Nick
  * Present
  * Movie
Hao/Jackie
  * Make sure that the robot is working with Tyler's original programs
    # We may want to do a quick presentation, time permitting
    # If you could make it work on a laptop, separate from the Presentation computer, it would probably make everything move more smoothly. You can set it up as we present, and we don't need to switch programs. 
Debarati
  * Make a mock UI
  * It should do the following, and can be completely scripted if you want
    # Import a Picture of a floorplan
    # Show the Picture in a window (like the emulator does now)
    # Click the image to select the destination
    # Draw Path(s) on the picture
    
  * This can be scripted with as few as three images: The blank floorplan, the floorplan plus a sprite image, the floorplan plus possible paths. 

  * The simplest way would be to use Tyler's Explorer2 program as a jumping-off point. Keep the video feed box in place, and use the existing input box to display the map. That way, your mouse-click handlers are already in place.
